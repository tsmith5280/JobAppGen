## [0.2.0] - 2025-05-24
### Added
- Full backend restructuring under `backend/` with `core/`, `routers/`, `static/`, and environment separation

### Changed
- Removed all remaining Streamlit dependencies, session logic, and UI calls
- Migrated state/profile persistence logic from `session.py` to Supabase + REST-based calls
- Split `main.py` into modular route handlers and helper services

### Fixed
- Corrected session-based profile fallback to dynamic user authentication
- Resolved broken state calls in former Streamlit logic by removing `st.session_state`

- Resume & cover letter generator interface (`2_Resume_and_Cover.py`, `resume_cover.py`, `generator.py`)
- Profile upload gating logic via dynamic user IDs
- SQL policies for RLS: insert/view/update/delete protections for `applications` and `user_profile`
- Foreign key relationships: `user_profile.user_id` â†’ `auth.users.id`

### Changed
- Updated `user_profile.skills` to use `text[]` array for advanced filtering
- Enhanced database constraints for safer cross-table integrity
